# Movie Rating Prediction System

A machine learning project designed to predict movie ratings based on various features such as budget, genre, release year, cast, and more.  
This system analyzes historical movie data to build predictive models that estimate likely ratings, helping in decision-making and movie success forecasting.  
Built using Python with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques to deliver accurate rating predictions.

## Features

- Predicts movie ratings using multiple influential features from movie datasets.  
- Implements data cleaning, feature scaling, and transformation for improved model accuracy.  
- Supports experimentation with different regression models for best results.  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- Required packages (install via pip):  
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/soumyakaruturi/Movie-Rating-Prediction-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```
   cd Movie-Rating-Prediction-System
   ```
3. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook containing your model code to train and test the prediction system.
